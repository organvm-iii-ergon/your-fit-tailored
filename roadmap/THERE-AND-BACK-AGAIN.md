# There & Back Again: The Complete Your-Fit-Tailored Journey

> A living roadmap from concept through pilot to scale

---

## 1. The Metaphor Explained

"There & back again" captures the essence of Your-Fit-Tailored at every level of operation.

**The Surface Meaning**: Garments go out to users and come back. A simple round trip that repeats weekly.

**The Deeper Meaning**: The business model itself is circular—not just in logistics, but in learning and investment. Each cycle that completes feeds the next. Returns generate fit data. Fit data improves allocation. Better allocation increases satisfaction. Satisfaction drives retention. Retention justifies investment. Investment expands inventory. Inventory enables more users. More users generate more returns.

**The Strategic Meaning**: This project follows the same pattern. We start with specification (there), validate through pilot (the journey), return with operational truth (back again), then venture further into scale. Each epoch builds on what the previous learned.

The metaphor reminds us that in a circular business, endings are beginnings. The goal is not to reach a destination but to establish a sustainable rhythm where "there & back" becomes invisible to users—always fresh, always fits, no thought required.

## 2. Constitutional Foundation

All design decisions flow from six invariants established in `memory/constitution.md`. These are non-negotiable truths that govern the system regardless of implementation choices.

### Invariant 1: Weekly Cadence

> 7-day cycles are non-negotiable; exceptions close with recovery, never skip.

- Every active user maps to exactly one `$WEEK_ID` at any time
- A delayed box is not "late shipping" but a broken cycle requiring explicit compensation
- Exceptions are allowed only as explicit state changes, not silent delays

### Invariant 2: Circular Inventory

> Garments are stateful assets with lifecycle bounds; inventory is closed-loop.

- A garment cannot be in two boxes at once
- A garment cannot re-enter Available without passing through inspection
- Every garment exit path (resale, donation, recycling) must be defined at intake

### Invariant 3: State Truth Discipline

> All entities auditable; single subsystem owns each state class.

- Exactly one subsystem is authoritative for each class of state
- External signals (carriers, facilities) are inputs that must be validated
- State transitions are event-driven and monotonic where possible

### Invariant 4: Explicit Failure Handling

> Failures are normal; recovery paths are first-class, not exceptions.

- Each failure resolves into: cost absorption, user compensation, or inventory adjustment
- No failure remains unclassified (unclassified failures accumulate as hidden debt)
- Recovery paths are designed upfront, not bolted on

### Invariant 5: Probabilistic Fit

> Fit is a belief distribution that evolves, not static measurement.

- Allocations must incorporate uncertainty and remain correct when predictions are wrong
- Each cycle should increase fit certainty or reduce uncertainty
- Both explicit and implicit signals inform fit beliefs

### Invariant 6: Cognitive Load Minimization

> System defaults for all routine decisions; user input optional.

- User cognitive load must asymptotically approach zero
- Users must never be required to understand the internal state machine
- Explicit user input is optional and rare

**Verification Question**: Does this choice reduce uncertainty, friction, or variance across cycles without increasing cognitive load on the user? If not, it violates the constitution.

## 7. Immediate Pre-Pilot Actions

Before launching the 25-user pilot, the following actions must be completed to de-risk the validation phase.

### Action 1: Mini-Pilot Validation (Critical)

**Purpose**: Validate return compliance before full pilot commitment.

**Scope**:
- 5 users ("friends and family")
- 2 weeks, full cycles
- Measure actual return timing distribution

**Success Criteria**: >90% on-time return without excessive friction.

**Why This Matters**: Return compliance is the "single weakest assumption" per the integrated specification. If users don't return on time, the entire cadence model breaks down. Better to learn this with 5 users than 25.

### Action 2: Price Cohort Test

**Purpose**: Validate unit economics at higher price point.

**Scope**:
- Split pilot: 15 users at $50/week, 10 users at $65/week
- Compare conversion, satisfaction, and contribution margin

**Success Criteria**: $65 cohort shows acceptable conversion with improved margin.

**Why This Matters**: At $50/week, contribution margin is ~14% with no safety buffer. The $65 price point provides margin headroom for operational variance.

### Action 3: Payment Integration Specification

**Purpose**: Complete payment handling specification before billing goes live.

**Required Deliverable**: `/specs/features/payment/spec.md` covering:
- Stripe/Braintree integration patterns
- Pre-authorization timing (at commitment)
- Decline handling workflow
- Refund/credit policies
- Settlement computation logic

## 8. Risk Analysis

Comprehensive risk assessment based on evaluation report findings. See `/analysis/evaluation-to-growth-report.md` for full analysis.

### Critical Risks

#### Risk 1: Return Compliance Cascade (CRITICAL)

**Description**: If late return rate exceeds 15%, a cascade of negative effects compounds:

```
p_late_return > 15%
       │
       ▼
Buffer $B must increase → More inventory per user
       │
       ▼
Capital tied up in buffer → Cash flow stress
       │
       ▼
Next cycle delayed → User trust erodes
       │
       ▼
Churn increases → Subscriber loss
       │
       ▼
Fixed costs spread over fewer users → Margin collapse
```

**Mitigation**:
- Pre-pilot validation with small cohort (Action 1 above)
- Aggressive deposit/hold policy
- Proactive return facilitation communications
- Clear escalation path defined in SOPs

**Status**: Unmitigated until mini-pilot completes.

#### Risk 2: Unit Economics Sensitivity (HIGH)

**Description**: The $7/week contribution margin at $50/week has no safety buffer.

Sensitivity analysis shows:
- If shipping increases from $34 to $50: Margin collapses
- If garment lifespan drops from 20 to 10 uses: Margin halves
- If cleaning cost doubles: Margin eliminated

**Mitigation**:
- Test higher price point ($65-75/week) in pilot
- Negotiate carrier rates before scale
- Monitor cost drivers weekly during pilot

**Status**: Partially mitigated (honest analysis exists, higher price cohort planned).

### Medium Risks

#### Risk 3: Airtable Scaling Limits (MEDIUM)

**Description**: Airtable constraints will become limiting factors:
- 50,000 record limit per base
- Rate limits on automations
- No real-time event streaming
- Limited concurrent user capacity

At 250 users × 52 weeks × 3 items = 39,000 garment-cycle records/year.

**Mitigation**:
- Document migration path to scalable platform (Postgres + custom app)
- Trigger migration planning before reaching 150 users
- Monitor record growth weekly

**Status**: Documented, not mitigated.

#### Risk 4: Manual Allocation Bottleneck (MEDIUM)

**Description**: Weekly allocation at pilot (25 cycles) requires 1-2 hours of operator time. At 250 users, this becomes 10-20 hours/week—essentially a full-time role.

**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize Fit Intelligence MVP before scaling past 75 users
- Begin specification work during pilot weeks 4-8
- Track allocation time weekly to model scaling curve

**Status**: Planned for Epoch 3.

#### Risk 5: Key Person Dependencies (MEDIUM)

**Description**: Pilot operations depend on specific individuals with no redundancy specified.

**Mitigation**:
- SOPs documented (complete)
- Cross-train operators during build phase
- Establish on-call rotation

**Status**: Partially mitigated.

## 11. Known Gaps and Future Work

*Updated 2026-01-29 based on Evaluation-to-Growth Report findings.*

### Critical Specification Gaps (Pre-Pilot)

| Gap | Current Status | Required For | Priority |
|-----|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **User Acquisition Strategy** | Absent | Pilot recruitment | Critical |
| **Payment Integration Specification** | Absent | Pilot billing | Critical |
| **Regulatory Compliance Checklist** | Absent | Legal protection | High |

**User Acquisition Gap**: Despite extensive operational specification, there is no plan for:
- User acquisition channels beyond "direct marketing" and "referral"
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) modeling
- Brand positioning and messaging strategy
- Timeline for recruiting 25 pilot users

**Payment Integration Gap**: Payment appears in state machines (HoldPayment state) but implementation is missing:
- No payment processor specified
- No billing cycle definition (pre-pay vs. post-pay)
- No deposit/liability policy specification
- Settlement computation logic undefined

**Regulatory Compliance Gap**: No specification addresses:
- Consumer protection regulations for subscription services
- State-by-state compliance requirements
- Sustainability claims verification (greenwashing risk)
- Data privacy (fit profiles contain body measurements)
- Health/hygiene certification requirements

### Specification Gaps (Post-Pilot)

| Gap | Current Status | Required For | Priority |
|-----|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Fit Intelligence Subsystem | Theoretical (Constitution §5) | Epoch 3 | High |
| Logistics Optimization | Partial (playbook SOPs) | Epoch 3 | Medium |

- Minimum viable recommendation algorithm
- Feedback capture UX
- Profile update triggers
- Confidence scoring methodology

### Financial Model Gaps

| Gap | Current Status | Required For | Priority |
|-----|----------------|--------------|----------|

### A.1 Evaluation Report Summary

The Evaluation-to-Growth Report (`analysis/evaluation-to-growth-report.md`) provides comprehensive analysis across 9 dimensions:

**Key Findings**:
- Constitution-driven design creates strong architectural coherence
- State transition contracts are production-ready
- Unit economics at $50/week are marginal (~14% contribution margin)
- Return compliance remains the single weakest assumption
- User acquisition strategy is absent

**Top Recommendations**:
1. Validate return compliance before full pilot launch with 5-user mini-pilot
2. Increase pilot price to $65-75/week or reduce cadence to improve margin safety
3. Prioritize user acquisition specification before scaling past pilot
